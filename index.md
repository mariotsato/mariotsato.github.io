#### **2022:** For and While loop comparison
<a href="pdf/assignment_2_Sato Mario.pdf">Experiment</a> conducted with statistical analysis of comparison between For and While loop.
Conclusion: For loop is relatively faster to do the counting rather than using while loops.
Check the analysis in the pdf clicking on the image.
