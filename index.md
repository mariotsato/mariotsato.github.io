#### *2023* Deploy your Object Detection app in Streamlit using YOLOv8 model (COCO dataset) 
Click <a href="https://mariotsato-yolov8-object-detection-streamlit-app-9gw2rr.streamlit.app/">here</a> to check the demo of object detection.
This is a project of object detection using YOLOv8 model with COCO dataset deployed in streamlit.

#### For and While loop comparison
<a href="pdf/assignment_2_Sato Mario.pdf">Experiment</a> conducted with statistical analysis of comparison between For and While loop.
Conclusion: For loop is relatively faster to do the counting rather than using while loops.
Check the analysis in the pdf clicking on the image.
