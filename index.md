### 1. Data Science Projects 


#### Deep Learning - U-Net model applied to the rope detection
A <a href="https://github.com/mariotsato/unet_rope_detection">project</a> carried on to apply the semantic segmentation to the rope detection.

#### For and While loop comparison
<a href="pdf/assignment_2_Sato Mario.pdf">Experiment</a> conducted with statistical analysis of comparison between For and While loop.
Conclusion: For loop is relatively faster to do the counting rather than using while loops.
Check the analysis in the pdf clicking on the image.
